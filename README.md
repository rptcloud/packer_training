## Packer Training

As Infrastructure as Code (IaC) continues to grow exponentially in the market, so do the skillsets needed to properly deploy and maintain the solution.

Packer is an open source tool for automated image management.  HashiCorp Packer automates the creation of any type of machine image. It embraces modern configuration management by encouraging you to use automated scripts to install and configure the software within your Packer-made images. Packer brings machine images into the modern age, unlocking untapped potential and opening new opportunities.

## A Note on Cloud Costs:

Throughout the labs, you will build multiple images across different regions. Genereally, you will incur very little cost for the creation of the AMIs. However, EBS-backed AMIs are made up of snapshots of the EBS volumes that form the AMI. You will pay storage fees for those snapshots according to the rates [listed here](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/).
